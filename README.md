# Multimodal-AI-YouTube-QA-Bot
This project is a multimodal AI chatbot that answers questions about YouTube videos using text or speech input. It uses Whisper for transcription, a RAG pipeline for accurate responses, and LangChain agents for coordination. The Gradio-based interface makes video content searchable, accessible, and interactive.
